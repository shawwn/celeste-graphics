# celeste-graphics

This is a repo containing Celeste's pixel art. I found it via [this
comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/celestegame/comments/gmtkmg/does_anyone_know_howwhere_to_get_sprite_sheets/fsstt7t/)

I assume it will get taken down eventually, but for now I just wanted
to toy with the graphics in aseprite. Please [buy
Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/) and
support the developers!
